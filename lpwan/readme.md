# LPWAN Examples

EVRYTHNG makes it easy to seamlessly connect devices to two of the leading LPWAN providers, [SigFox](http://www.sigfox.com) and [Things Connected](https://www.thingsconnected.net/). Read more about our partnerships with SigFox and Things Connected in our [blog](https://evrythng.com/blog/). 

To setup a SigFox or Things Connected EVRYTHNG integration, please consult our online documentation for [SigFox](https://developers.evrythng.com/docs/sigfox-integration) and [Things Connected](https://developers.evrythng.com/docs/things-connected-integration).


These examples will get you started with LPWAN integrations for SigFox and Things Connected. 

- [SigFoxMkr1200.ino](./SigFoxMkr1200.ino) Reads the built-in temperature sensor on a [Arduino MKRFOX 1200](https://store.arduino.cc/arduino-mkrfox1200)
- [ThingsConnected.ino](./ThingsConnected.ino) Reads the built-in temperature  sensor on a [SODAQ ExpLoRer](http://support.sodaq.com/sodaq-one/explorer/) and sends the data to the Things Connected platform.
